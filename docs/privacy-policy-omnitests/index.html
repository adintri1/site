<p>This privacy policy describes the collection of personal information by omnitests, (“<b>omnitests</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”) from users of the application and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed.

<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>

<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>,” as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual&rsquo;s name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” or other non-personally identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed.</p>

By doing this, you authorize us to access and store the credentials you provide, such as your name, email address(es), age range, gender, country, profile picture, language, friend list and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy.

<p><b>Links</b></p>

<p>The Service may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate.

Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk.
<b></b></p>
